# Dataset Explanation:

The dataset was actually a collection of more than 1,80,000 experiences of worldwide terrorist attacks.

# Project Summary:

The task was to explore and analyze the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017) to discover key findings pertaining to terrorist activities. 

Created two separate data frames one for categorical variables and one for numerical variables for understanding the statistics differently, looked for anomalies and done data visualization

Formulated fruitful results that can help in building solid future strategies to fight against the terrorist gangs.

# Potential Impact and Future Scope:

A Key finding of the analysis describes that the mean latitude of all attacks is 23.5 deg North which is exactly the Tropic of Cancer holding the world's best geographical locations. This clearly indicates that all the terrorist gangs are unitedly working towards capturing the world's best geographical locations to rule the world.

Thus the line of thinking of this EDA can be utilized by all the nations to fight against this united evil.
